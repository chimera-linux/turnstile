turnstiled.conf(5)

# NAME

turnstiled.conf - the *turnstiled*(8) configuration file

# DESCRIPTION

The file _turnstiled.conf_ contains the daemon's configuration.
It typically resides in _/etc/turnstile_ (or your sysconfdir of choice).

While the daemon can run without any configuration file thanks to its
built-in defaults, there are many options that the user may want to
adjust to their liking.

# SYNTAX

The configuration file has a simple line-based syntax. Each option line
consists of the option name and option value separated by the '=' symbol.

Comments start with the '#' symbol. All whitespace is ignored, including
lines containing only whitespace, trailing whitespace, leading whitespace
and whitespace inbetween names.

Only 1024 characters at most are read per line, including whitespace. If
longer, the rest is simply ignored.

# OPTIONS

This is the list of possible options, with their type and default value,
as well as additional description.

Boolean options accept only the values _yes_ and _no_. Other options may
accept more values.

*debug* (boolean: _no_)
	Whether to output debug information. This is verbose logging that is
	only useful when investigating issues.

*backend* (string: _dinit_)
	The service backend to use. The default and currently the only shipped
	backend is _dinit_, but others may be implemented.

	Can also be set to _none_ to disable the service backend. In that case,
	nothing will be spawned, but the daemon will still perform login tracking
	and auxiliary tasks such as rundir management.

*debug\_stderr* (boolean: _no_)
	Whether to print debug messages also to stderr.

*linger* (combo: _maybe_)
	Whether to keep already started services running even after the last login
	of the user is gone. The default behavior is to stop them unless a file
	with the same name as the user exists in _@LINGER_PATH@_.

	It is not necessary to log in and out when the linger directory is changed,
	as the current state is checked upon last logout.

	Note that lingering is disabled when _manage\_rundir_ is set to no. That is
	because various user services may be relying on the rundir's existence,
	and it cannot be deleted until the user is gone. This is overridable with
	an environment variable (for those who worked around it on their own).

	Valid values are _yes_, _no_ and _maybe_.

*rundir\_path* (string: _@RUN_PATH@/usr/%u_)
	The value of _$XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR_ that is exported into the user service
	environment. Special values _%u_ (user ID), _%g_ (group ID) and _%%_
	(the character '%') are allowed and substituted in the string. Set to
	empty string if you want to prevent it from being exported altogether.

	It must not end with a slash, be relative or be just the root filesystem.

	If you are using elogind, you should not mess with this path, and doing
	so will result in subtly broken systems. You should in general not mess
	with this path.

*manage\_rundir* (boolean: _@MANAGE_RUNDIR@_)
	Whether to manage the _$XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR_. This may conflict with other
	rundir management methods, such as elogind, so when turning it on, make
	sure this is not the case.

	It is a requirement for the linger functionality to work.

	The default is dependent on the build.

*export\_dbus\_address* (boolean: _yes_)
	Whether to export _$DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS\_ADDRESS_ into the environment.
	When enabled, this will be exported and set to 'unix:path=RUNDIR/bus'
	where RUNDIR is the expanded value of _rundir\_path_. This works
	regardless of if rundir is managed.

*login\_timeout* (integer: _60_)
	The timeout for the login (in seconds). If the user services that are a
	part of the initial startup process take longer than this, the service
	manager	instance is terminated and all connections to the session are
	closed.
